```c title=mutex_lock()
/**
 * mutex_lock - acquire the mutex
 * @lock: the mutex to be acquired
 *
 * Lock the mutex exclusively for this task. If the mutex is not
 * available right now, it will sleep until it can get it.
 *
 * The mutex must later on be released by the same task that
 * acquired it. Recursive locking is not allowed. The task
 * may not exit without first unlocking the mutex. Also, kernel
 * memory where the mutex resides must not be freed with
 * the mutex still locked. The mutex must first be initialized
 * (or statically defined) before it can be locked. memset()-ing
 * the mutex to 0 is not allowed.
 *
 * (The CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES .config option turns on debugging
 * checks that will enforce the restrictions and will also do
 * deadlock debugging)
 *
 * This function is similar to (but not equivalent to) down().
